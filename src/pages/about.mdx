Hi this is Fraser.

I'm a web developer from China, now live and work in Melbourne. I currently work for [Envato](https://envato.com) as a senior front-end developer.

The main project I'm working on now is [Envato Elements](https://elements.envato.com/), before that I also worked on [Milkshake](https://milkshake.app/) and [Envato Market](https://themeforest.net).

This website is built with [Gatsbyjs](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), I rebuit my previous blog site from Jekyll based staic site on [fraserxu.me](https://fraserxu.me) to this one on [fraserxu.dev](https://fraserxu.dev). This site might be over engineered but I mainly want to use it to learn and play with different technologies that may or not use in work.
